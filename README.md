# Introduction

In this project, we explore the application of various stochastic process models for optimization and decision making, implemented using the Python programming language.

## Implemented Methods

* **Successive Enumerations:**
- This method involves exhaustively exploring all possible decision policies to find the optimal one, evaluating each one based on specific performance criteria.

* **Policy Improvement:**
- We use iterative techniques to continuously improve an initial decision policy, based on feedback from observed performance.

* **Policy Improvement with Discount:**
- Similar to policy improvement, but considering the influence of time through a discount factor that prioritizes short-term benefits over future ones.

* **Successive Approximations:**
- We implement iterative methods to improve a decision policy through successive approximations of the objective function.

* **Linear Policy Programming (LPP):**
- We formulate the stochastic decision problem as a linear programming problem, representing decision policies in a linear manner and optimizing them under specific constraints.

## Implementation

Each model is implemented using libraries and tools available in Python, taking advantage of its flexibility and computational efficiency. This approach allows us to not only explore the theory behind each method, but also develop practical and scalable solutions for real optimization problems.
